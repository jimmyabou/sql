**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my past work in the medical field, where I was testing machine learning models to detect melanoma from images uploaded by patients, it's clear that ethics and fairness are very important. Our algorithms had trouble accurately identifying melanoma in people with darker skin tones compared to those with lighter skin. This problem shows a bias in the technology, which could lead to unfair healthcare results.

To fix this, we really need to make sure our datasets have a wide range of skin tones. This can help our algorithms be more accurate and fair for everyone. Also, we need to keep checking our models for any biases and correct them when we find them.

Another part of our work was detecting and assessing ulcer wounds in elderly patients. Early-stage ulcers are harder to see on darker skin tones than on lighter skin, which makes accurate detection difficult. This unfairness means we need to develop better techniques to identify ulcers early in all patients, no matter their skin tone.

Patient consent and data privacy are also very important. We have to get clear consent from patients before using their data and images. Respecting patient privacy is not only an ethical duty but also crucial for gaining trust. This involves being clear about how we use, store, and protect their data.

Addressing these ethical and fairness issues needs a comprehensive approach. We need to improve the technical side of our models to make sure they are unbiased and fair, and follow the highest ethical standards in handling data. By including these considerations in our work, we can create machine learning models that are both effective and fair, leading to better healthcare for all patients, regardless of their skin tone or background.
